## Description

RedditGecko! is a response web app that automatically pushes Reddit news feed on on crypto currencies. Once the user logged in, he is presented with a sticker board which has 6 automatically updating stickers. Each sticker includes a type of crypto currency, its price information in the past 24 hours and a relevant Reddit about it. By combing price information and Reddit post, RedditEcko! gives the user a cut-edge adavange in information gathering for crypto currency.

### User_Story

- You are an investor in cryptocurrency.
- You need a web host where you can easily track my crypto currency investment.
- With the web host, you will be able to store your investment info, and keep updated with latest related Reddit posts.

### Features

**What needs are we meeting?**

- Information is probablly the most valuable resource to crypto currency investor nowdays. Among all the new different information sharing platforms, Reddit is the most popular one. However, the nature of Reddit doesn't give the user options to quickly peak into the information. Moreover, switching between price index sites and Reddit page can be pain when user is trying to track multiple crypto currencies. With RedditGecko!, we want to deliver a integrated experience that:

1. Display the crucial price information together with the Reddit post.
2. Automatically refresh and generate new Reddit posts to keep user update to market movement.

**What would be the foreseeable consequence of the needs if unmet?**

- If we do not meet the aforementioned needs of the investors, then:

1. The investors will not be supplied with the broad array of options, so they may make an informed and confident decision in engaging in cryptocurrency investment.
2. We will not be able to inspire others to push our global interactions to the next step in history.

**What were our goals?**

- Wire up two server-side APIs.
- Construct a responsive UI.
- Create an interactive UI(i.e. respond to User's input).
- Use the client-side storage to store User's data object.
- Use a CSS framework: Bootstrap, but do NOT use JS popup dialogue boxes (i.e. JS alerts, confirms, or prompts).
- Exercise best coding practice.
- Deploy a working application to GitHub Repo.
